      Happy Valentines Day Riley!
      <p>
        I really wanted to do something special for Valentines day so I made
        this webpage. There are so many special memories that we have shared and
        if I tried to write about every single one, the page would never end so
        I wanted to highlight some of my most favorite:) and not only that, but
        also some of my most favorite things about you to hopefully give you at
        least a little bit of an idea as to how much you mean to me. Hope you
        like it :)

          Ok! so let me just start from the beginning, I can still remember
          leaving senior sunset and let me tell you, you definitely left your
          impression on me becuase after we had reconnected, I found myself
          thinking about you all the time, it was almost as if no time had ever
          passed! Fast forward to prom...even though we didn't go together that
          night was unforgetable. I was so eager to get to Craig's just so I
          could see you and I still remember so vividly the excited feeling I
          got when I walked in and saw you handstand pushups to later find out
          that it was because some guy thought you couldn't do one and I
          couldn't help but think like ok... shes a freaking beast. Anyway after
          that night I knew in my heart that there was something special about
          you and boy was I right!

        The next memory that I want to highlight is Zoo Lights! Oh my godness,
        that had to be one of the most fun nights that I have ever had and it is
        definitely up there on the top of list as one of my most favorite
        memories of us. First of all I remember picking you up and you looked
        absolutely STUNNING! I mean drop dead GORGEOUS! Anyway...then jamming
        out in the car to some absolute bangers like "You Belong with me",
        "Replay", and "Don't Run Away" was so much fun, idk something about
        singing those together at the top of our lungs was so awesome. As
        amazing as the car ride was, that wasn't even the best part, when we
        finally got there and into the Zoo, it literally felt like being in a
        Hallmark movie, but talking and walking around, taking pictures, being
        all goofy and couply, was just so amazing I can't express how much fun
        that was and how happy I was to be doing that stuff with you. UH , but
        YOU made that night so special for me and I was just so happy and so
        thankful that you were the one I got to share those moments with. Some
        of the moments to highlight though were: when we went back around the
        2nd time and nobody was there, When I snatched your beanie..., when I uh
        smacked uh you know but you had your weight distributed to one of your
        legs and the sound that it made was hilarious! Anyway yeah the drive
        back was just as amazing as the drive there and oh my gosh sorry I have
        to comment on you again, like you looked so FREAKING amazing! I remember
        looking back at all the photos we took so many times just thinking about
        how much fun I just had and how thankful I am to have you in my
        life...so yeah thanks so much for that amazing night again!

        Ok the next memory that I wanted to highlight our first date at Wash
        Park...I remember picking you up at your house and so vivdly recall
        being absolutely stunned the moment I saw you walk out the front door
        and you were wearing that blue top with the little white flowers...yeah
        I was speechless because of how beautiful you looked, and I probably
        looked so dumb standing there with my jaw gaping open haha...but than we
        drove to Bonnie Brae and you got Rocky Road, and some cashew flavor ice
        cream...Im pretty sure, and I got Salted Caramel Oreo and some brownie
        flavored one and then we shared...ahh so romantic haha, but then we
        walked to wash park while talking about scary movies and other things,
        and then we found ourselves in the middle of the field stargazing and I
        was thinking to myself "it can't get any better than this" I mean
        seriously though I was on a date with the girl of my dreams...sharing
        ice cream...laying down...stargazing, like talk about my head was in the
        clouds haha, but as you know, well at least in my opinion it did did get
        better haha ;) the funny part was after I still was unsure about if you
        actually wanted to be my girlfriend...yeah I was pretty dumb haha. Then
        we walked back and I drove you home, I remember walking back to my car
        from your driveway with one thought in my head..."she's the one".
