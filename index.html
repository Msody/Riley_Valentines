    <header>Happy Valentines Day Riley!</header>
    <p>
      I really wanted to do something special for Valentines day so I made this
      webpage. There are so many special memories that we have shared and if I
      tried to write about every single one, the page would never end so I
      wanted to highlight some of my most favorite:) and not only that, but also
      some of my most favorite things about you to hopefully give you at least a
      little bit of an idea as to how much you mean to me. Hope you like it :)

        Ok! so let me just start from the beginning, I can still remember
        leaving senior sunset and let me tell you, you definitely left your
        impression on me becuase I found myself thinking about you all the time
        after we had reconnected, it was almost as if no time had ever passed.
        Fast forward to prom...even though we didn't go together that night was
        unforgetable. I was so eager to get to Craig's just so I could see you
        and I still remember so vividly the excited feeling I got when I walked
        in and saw you handstand pushups to later find out that it was because
        some guy thought you couldn't do one and I couldn't help but think like
        ok... shes a freaking beast. Anyway after that night I knew in my heart
        that there was something special about you and boy was I right XD
