    <header>Happy Valentines Day Riley!
    <p>
      I really wanted to do something special for Valentines day so I made this
      webpage. There are so many special memories that we have shared and if I
      tried to write about every single one, the page would never end so I
      wanted to highlight some of my most favorite:) and not only that, but also
      some of my most favorite things about you to hopefully give you at least a
      little bit of an idea as to how much you mean to me. Hope you like it :)

        Ok! so let me just start from the beginning, I can still remember
        leaving senior sunset and let me tell you, you definitely left your
        impression on me becuase I found myself thinking about you all the time
        after we had reconnected, it was almost as if no time had ever passed.
        Fast forward to prom...even though we didn't go together that night was
        unforgetable. I was so eager to get to Craig's just so I could see you
        and I still remember so vividly the excited feeling I got when I walked
        in and saw you handstand pushups to later find out that it was because
        some guy thought you couldn't do one and I couldn't help but think like
        ok... shes a freaking beast. Anyway after that night I knew in my heart
        that there was something special about you and boy was I right!

          The next memory that I want to highlight is Zoo Lights! Oh my godness,
          that had to be one of the most fun nights that I have ever had and it 
          is definitely up there on the top of list as one of my most favorite 
          memories of us. First of all I remember picking you up and you looked 
          absolutely STUNNING! I mean drop dead GORGEOUS! Anyway...then jamming 
          out in the car to some absolute bangers like "You Belong me", "Replay",
          and "Don't Run Away" was so much fun, idk something about singing 
          those together at the top of our lungs was so awesome. As amazing as
          the car ride was, that wasn't even the best part, when we finally got
          there and into the Zoo it literally felt like being in a Hallmark 
          movie, but talking and walking around, taking pictures, being all
          goofy and couply, you made that night so special for me and I was
          just so happy and so thankful that you were the one I got to share
          those moments with. Some of the moments to highlight though were: when we went back around 
          the 2nd time and nobody was there, When I snatched your beanie..., 
          when I uh smacked uh you know but you had your weight distributed 
          to one of your legs and the sound that it made was hilarious!
          Anyway yeah the drive back was just as amazing as the drive there
          and oh my gosh sorry I have to comment on you again, like you looked
          so FREAKING amazing! I remember looking back at all the photos we 
          took so many times just thinking about how much fun I just had and how
          thankful I am to have you in my life...so yeah thanks so much for that 
          amazing night again!
